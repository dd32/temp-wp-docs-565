<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most WordPress plugins are released under the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_blank">GPL</a>, which is the same license thatÂ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wordpress.org/about/license/" target="_blank">WordPress itself uses</a>. However, there are other compatible options available. It is always best to clearly indicate the license your plugin uses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/the-basics/header-requirements/">Header Requirements</a> section, we briefly mentioned how you can indicate your&nbsp;plugin's license within the plugin header comment. Another common, and encouraged, practice is to place a license block comment near the top of your main plugin file (the same one that has the plugin header comment).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This license block comment usually looks something like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code {"language":"php"} -->
